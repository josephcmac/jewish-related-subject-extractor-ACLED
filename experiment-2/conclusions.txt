The false positives were because:
- USA22410: Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee is mentioned, but the demostration is not related to Israel.
- USA50439: National Council of Jewish Women involved in demostration that is not specific about Jews or Israel.


The false negative USA71054 was because I did not consider the nazi salute "Siege Heil".
